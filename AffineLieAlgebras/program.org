Research program
* Connection between affine Lie algebras and Conformal Field Theory
* Connection between affine Lie algebras and modular forms
*** Modular forms <-> Prime numbers?
***** Affine lie algebras <-> Prime numbers ??
* Maple Program
*** Expand to twisted algebras
*** TODO Compute string functions for $A^{(2)}_2$
***** TODO Check construction of weights according to books of Klimyk and Kac
***** TODO Introduce positive roots
*** TODO Try folding of fan
