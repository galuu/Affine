Reviewers' comments:

Reviewer #1: The program can be useful for theoretical physicist working in representation theory of affine algebras etc.
The introduction from representation theory is standardly and clear written. For this reason the paper  certainly
deserves publication in the journal Computer Physics Communication.



Reviewer #2: In this article, the author presents a Mathematica package for Lie
algebra representation theory that can perform a number of important
calculations such as tensor product decomposition and branching of
representations for affine Lie algebras. (Finite-dimensional Lie
algebras are naturally supported as well).

While the corresponding algorithms are mostly standard knowledge, this
package certainly is useful for researchers who would like to do such
calculations directly within Mathematica. (For some of the more common
problems, such as decomposing tensor products for small
finite-dimensional Lie algebra representations, there are a number of
other specialized packages, a number of which are not based on
Mathematica.)

The underlying code is reasonably well written and documented. The
basic data structures have been chosen quite appropriately and
efficient algorithms have been employed. All this makes using this
package quite practical, and the degree of novelty and achievement to
me seems appropriate for publication in CPC.

There are numerous very minor grammatical issues with the write-up; On
page 5, "finite" was mis-spelled as "inite", and in many places an
article "the" is missing (e.g.: p.3, line 27 "is the most
computation-intensitive one", line 37: "constitute an important and
tractable class", p. 4, line 13: "The next section", line 26: "A Lie
algebra g is... which is called a/the Lie bracket..."; similarly for
"(A) Cartan subalgebra", "(The) Killing form", "(A) special choice of
basis", "The loop algebra ... corresponding to the semisimple Lie
algebra" etc.) These are too numerous to list them all in this
report. While the article still is quite readable without these
cosmetic corrections, it would benefit from being proofread by a
native speaker.

I have stronger concerns about the style in which some references are
given, such as [2],[5],[6],[12],[16],[31]. This clearly is
inappropriate. At the very least, the author should reference preprint
references (e.g. for arXiv preprints), and possibly web pages.


So, my recommendation is to accept this article for publication once:

  - the references have been corrected, and

  - the author addressed the issue of missing "the/a/an" articles to an
    extent he is happy to see in print with his name on it.

Highlights are a short collection of bullet points that convey the core findings and provide readers with a quick textual overview of the article. These three to five bullet points describe the essence of the research (e.g. results or conclusions) and highlight what is distinctive about it.

Highlights will be displayed in online search result lists, the contents list and in the online article, but will not (yet) appear in the article PDF file or print.

Author instructions:
Highlights should be submitted as a separate file in EES by selecting "Highlights" from the drop-down list when uploading files. Please adhere to the specifications below.
	
	

Specifications:

    Include 3 to 5 highlights.
    There should be a maximum of 85 characters, including spaces, per highlight.
    Only the core results of the paper should be covered.

Highlights

    We model two hospitals which have regulated prices and compete on quality.
    We examine changes in the level of information about hospital quality.
    Increasing information will increase quality if hospital costs are similar.
    Increasing information will decrease quality if hospital costs are very different.
    Welfare effects depend on ex-ante or ex-post assumptions about quality information.

Highlights

    Highly c-axis oriented ZnO nanowires were grown on glass using aqueous solutions.
    The growth temperature does not exceed 95 Â°C in any step of the synthesis.
    The photocatalytic and wetting properties were studied upon UV irradiation.
    ZnO nanowires show superior photocatalytic activity.
    We report a reversible photo-induced transition from hydrophobic to super-hydrophilic.

Highlights

    A conformational two-state mechanism for proton pumping complex I is proposed.
    The mechanism relies on stabilization changes of anionic ubiquinone intermediates.
    Electron-transfer and protonation should be strictly controlled during turnover.
    The mechanism explains the full reversibility of complex I.

Highlights

    Fading of a script alone does not foster domain-general strategy knowledge.
    Performance of the strategy declines during the fading of a script.
    Monitoring by a peer keeps performance of the strategy up during script fading.
    Performance of a strategy after fading fosters domain-general strategy knowledge.
    Fading and monitoring by a peer combined foster domain-general strategy knowledge.
